1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project is a simple clock application that displays the time in both 12 and 24 hour formats.

2. What did you do particularly well?
One thing I did particularly well was increment the seconds by one second. This uses the usleep() function to pause for 1 second before incrementing the time. 

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have possibly created the main function smaller. I also may have been able to incorporate header files in as well. 

4. Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found creating the functions themselves to be fairly challenging. I was not sure the best way to approach displaying the user interface. I just started with the supporting document and used that as a guide.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Taking the steps one by one will be a helpful skill to transfer to other projects. It is how I approach any big assignment. I just start with the first task and only focus on that. For instance, with this clock application, I just started with how to go about displaying both versions of the clock to the screen, before factoring in any logic of time. 

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I added some comments throughout the code, and I also tried to keep the indentation consistent throughout as well. I also tried to create error messages that were easily understandable for the user.
